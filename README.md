# Project  

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  

## 📝 Note   
The application is optimized for SSR. If you run the server in dev mode it will be slower, please follow the instructions below.
